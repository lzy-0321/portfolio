## Steam Games Integration

The website features a dynamic entertainment section that displays your recently played Steam games. To set this up:

1. Get your Steam API credentials:
   - Get your Steam API Key from: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
   - Find your Steam ID using: https://steamid.io/

2. Add the credentials to your `.env.local`:
   ```plaintext
   STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key
   STEAM_ID=your_steam_id
   ```

3. The integration will:
   - Display your recently played games
   - Show game descriptions and playtime
   - Auto-update based on your Steam activity
   - Cache results to minimize API calls

Note: Make sure your Steam profile's game details are set to public for this feature to work.

## Security Enhancements

The Steam games integration has been enhanced with several security measures:

1. Server-Side Only API Calls
   - All Steam API calls are restricted to server-side execution
   - Client-side API calls are prevented with runtime checks
   - Uses Next.js server components for secure data fetching

2. Data Caching System
   - Implements a secure file-based caching mechanism
   - Cache expiry set to 1 hour by default
   - Reduces API call frequency and potential abuse
   - Cache updates handled exclusively on server side

3. Environment Variables
   ```plaintext
   STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key    # Required for Steam API access
   STEAM_ID=your_steam_id              # Your Steam account ID
   ```

4. Best Practices
   - API credentials are never exposed to the client
   - Uses proper HTTP headers for API requests
   - Implements error handling and logging
   - Cache directory is properly secured

Note: Make sure to keep your API keys and credentials secure and never commit them to version control.
